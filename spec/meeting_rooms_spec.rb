# build meeting room object, knows its buckets of time,

# You are in charge of assigning meeting rooms at your company. Especially many meetings have been planned for next Thursday. so you decided to write a program to help you fit the meetings within your time constraints.
# There are 2 meeting rooms

# The meetings have to be scheduled during core work hours (09:00 - 17:00)
# No meetings can be scheduled during lunchtime (12:00 - 13:00)

# Meetings at your company never overrun and can be scheduled back-to-back. with no gaps in between them.
# Apart from these constraints, meetings can be placed anywhere. and the duration of gaps between them doesn't matter.
# The input contains one meeting per line; the meeting title can contain any characters and is followed by a space and the meeting duration. which is always given in minutes. Since multiple meeting configurations are possible, the test output given here is only one of the possible solutions. and your output doesnâ€˜t have to match it as long as it meets all constraints.

# Please submit your answer as a link to a github repository {or the program you wrote.
